## About

> I am a developer with a passion for automation.

I always knew I liked puzzles and problem solving, but it was only a couple of years into engineering physics master that I realized I *love* coding. Since then, I've been learning constantly. First, I was charmed by Java and OOP, and spent many a sleepless night on a game based on quantum mechanics theory. Shortly afterwards, I delved into optimizing search algorithms in C++, only to then spend an autumn writing a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) for maze solving in Python, inspired by [Conway's cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Before I started working, I had dismissed web development, scared away by unorderly chunks of HTML I had glimpsed now and again.

**But then there was [React](https://reactjs.org/).** The ease with which reusable components could be composed into beautiful websites, with predictable state management, had me hooked. Since then, the spare time left to me after work and choir practice is spent with JavaScript. And while that is good and all, it is coupled with a healthy dose of fullstack development during work hours.

In both contexts, I strive to achieve automation. I want development &ndash; and life &ndash; to be smooth, and I am determined to find &ndash; or write &ndash; the applications that will take me there. Leave the busywork to [robots](https://dependabot.com/).
